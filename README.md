Introduction
Scholastic’s Classroom Magazine business sells magazine subscriptions to individual teachers
in grade schools (elementary, middle, high) for use in their classrooms. There are 26 different
magazine titles available, each focused on a different grade and subject matter (reading, math,
etc.). One subscription to one of these magazines contains enough copies to distribute to an
entire class (usually 15-35 students). Sometimes a school will have a central coordinator for
magazine subscriptions, and sometimes the teachers place their orders individually. These
subscriptions are paid for in two main ways - the teacher can use their own money, or the
subscription can be paid for by the school district in which the teacher’s school resides.
The magazine business co-exists with three other Scholastic businesses doing business in
grade schools - a catalog business, an on-site event business, and a B2B business selling
educational solutions.
Request from Magazine Business
While annual revenue increased from 2017 to 2019, due to a price increase in 2017, we saw at
least a 1% decline annually in subscriptions from 2017 to 2019. The Magazine business’
request to the Data Science team is to conduct analysis and give a recommendation for how
Magazines can increase the number of subscriptions via marketing.

Questions:
1. Conduct an exploratory data analysis to characterize buildings that contribute to the
most loss. Please summarize your findings. (Note: The data provided is limited to
elementary schools - i.e. schools containing grades up to 6th grade)
2. In order to fulfil the Magazine business’ request, the Data Science team is tasked with
building a predictive model to make data-driven marketing decisions. Using the data
provided, your task is to build a model to identify which school buildings Magazines
should target in order to increase subscriptions.
a. You may choose to build one of the following models that could lead to impactful
recommendations.
i. an attrition model, identifying buildings that are at risk for reducing or not
renewing their subscriptions,
ii. a model uncovering the features of high-performing schools and potential
upselling opportunities,
iii. or you may choose to develop a solution of your own that could bring
values to business.
b. Prepare a summary of your modeling work and results, as if you were explaining
to the rest of the Data Science team. Please be specific on all the steps you take
to build a final model including exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing,
feature construction and model performance evaluation.
3. Based on the learnings from the model built in question #2, what are the
recommendations you would make to the Magazine business? Please prepare a few
slides summarizing your findings and recommendations, keeping in mind how you would
explain the results to a non-technical audience.
You should be prepared to present your analyses, findings and recommendations during your
Super Day interview.
